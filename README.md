# MyReads Project

This is my completed MyReads Project for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.
Allows users to search for books and add/remove them from thier bookshelf. Users can mark books as Read, Currently Reading, or Want To Read

## TL;DR

To start the application:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
